# Programming with Google Go

My solutions for Coursera's "Programming with Google Go" specialization.

* Getting started with Go
* Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go
* Concurrency in Go

There is a simple CI, but test coverage is unfortunately rather low.
This is partially because of the problem design in the course 
that explicitely asked to code methods that print instead of
returning the results (side-effects)...
